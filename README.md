hey gang this is very poorly maintained because uhhhhhhhhh i have no idea

ill update it every once when i can remember (some of it may be vibe-coded because i was either lazy, demotivated, tired, things i was trying wasnt working out, etc. etc.)

not my proudest work i guess but i have no idea what else to do!!! so please bear with me

i get data from https://bacdive.dsmz.de/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/

this has both the predictive model and the automated datascraper just look at the names they should be pretty intuitive
